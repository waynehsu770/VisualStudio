### TwentyOne ###
TwentyOne is based off the popular card game: Blackjack. It is a console application that not only allows a user to enter name, money but also has options for the users to decide whether to hit, stay, continue playing or stop. It also has logic in it that calculates the dealer's hands, win or lose for players and dealer, and also the winnings and losses for either party. 

### Car Insurance ###
This is a MVC web application that is a practice car insurance website that allows a user to enter information like name, date of birth, car information and driving history etc. It has a business logic that calculates the user's quote based on the entered user information. There is also an admin page that allows the staff to view all the users' names, email and quotes.

### Student Database ###
This is a small database first console application that was a practice to allow me to understand how the database first approach works in the Entity Framework.
